- Issues in Python bindings (e.g., unsafe memory access across the C++/Python boundary)

## What NOT to Report

- General bugs — use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pypto/pypto/issues)
- Feature requests — use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pypto/pypto/issues)

## Disclosure Policy

PyPTO follows coordinated disclosure:

1. Vulnerability is reported privately via GitHub Security Advisories
2. The team acknowledges and triages the report
3. A fix is developed privately
4. A security advisory is published alongside the fix release
5. Credit is given to the reporter (unless they prefer anonymity)
