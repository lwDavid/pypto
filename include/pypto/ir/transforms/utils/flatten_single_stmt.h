 * @brief Recursively flatten single-statement SeqStmts and OpStmts
 *
 * This utility simplifies IR by removing unnecessary nesting:
 * - SeqStmts with only one statement is replaced by that statement
 * - OpStmts with only one statement is replaced by that statement
 * - Process is applied recursively
 *
 * Example transformations:
 *   SeqStmts([OpStmts([AssignStmt(x, 1)])])
 *   => AssignStmt(x, 1)
 *
 *   SeqStmts([OpStmts([AssignStmt(x, 1), AssignStmt(y, 2)])])
 *   => OpStmts([AssignStmt(x, 1), AssignStmt(y, 2)])
 *
 *   Function body = SeqStmts([OpStmts([AssignStmt(x, 1)])])
 *   => Function body = AssignStmt(x, 1)
 *
 * Note: This pass does NOT enforce that Function/IfStmt/ForStmt body must be SeqStmts.
 * It will flatten them if they contain only a single statement.
 *
 * @param func Input function
 * @return Transformed function with flattened single-statement blocks
