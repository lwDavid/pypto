"""Type wrappers for PyPTO Language DSL.

This module provides type annotation and runtime wrapper classes for PyPTO's language DSL:
- Scalar: Scalar values with specific data types
- Tensor: Multi-dimensional arrays in global memory
- Tile: Memory blocks in unified buffer memory for block-level programming
