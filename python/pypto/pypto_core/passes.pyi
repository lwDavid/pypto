    Initializes MemRef for all variables in functions.
    Sets memory space to UB by default, or DDR for block.load/block.store operands.

    Uses dependency analysis to identify memory reuse opportunities.
    Variables with non-overlapping lifetimes in the same memory space can
    share MemRef objects.

    Analyzes data dependencies and inserts synchronization operations
    (sync_src, sync_dst, bar_v, bar_m) for correct execution across hardware pipes.

        Pass object that inserts synchronization operations

def add_alloc() -> Pass:
    """Create an add alloc pass.

    This pass traverses all TileType variables in each Function and creates alloc operations
    for each unique MemRef. The alloc operations are added at the beginning of the function.

    The pass performs the following steps:
    1. Identifies all TileType variables in the function
    2. Collects all unique MemRef objects from these TileType variables
    3. Creates an alloc operation for each unique MemRef
    4. Prepends these alloc operations to the function body

    Each alloc operation has no input/output arguments but is bound to a MemRef pointer
    to track memory allocation for that specific buffer.

def convert_to_ssa() -> Pass:
    """Create an SSA conversion pass.

    This pass converts non-SSA IR to SSA form by:
    1. Renaming variables with version suffixes (x -> x_0, x_1, x_2)
    2. Adding phi nodes (return_vars + YieldStmt) for IfStmt control flow divergence
    3. Converting loop-modified variables to iter_args + return_vars pattern

    The pass handles:
    - Straight-line code: multiple assignments to the same variable
    - If statements: variables modified in one or both branches
    - For loops: variables modified inside the loop body
    - Mixed SSA/non-SSA: preserves existing SSA structure while converting non-SSA parts
